- The early idea of an internet run by a group of normal people is so simple and amazing that the modern gentrified internet because of monopolies like [[Google]], [[Facebook]], and [[Amazon]] looks horrible in comparison
- This is a more positive outlook of the mindset that the internet should be free and open to all
	- free as in FREE not at the expense of your data and information but actually free
	- this reminds me of the modern free and open source movement which is trying to maintain that vision of free is FREE without an asterisk and that these systems we use daily should be open and accessable to all, not just mysterious black boxes

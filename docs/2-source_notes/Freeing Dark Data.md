### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article discusses the idea of "Dark Data" wherein uninteresting scientific studies and those owned by corperations that don't have a positive outcome are shelved and are never published to be seen by the public. They also talked about how the financial gatekeeping of the scientific field is bad for society and science as a whole. 

Overall I think that the ideas discussed are good, however in my opinion the article doesn't discuss enough solutions to the problem. My guess on why that is is partly because its issues rooted in systemic issues from the capitalist system which can't be entirely fixed without uprooting the entire system itself.

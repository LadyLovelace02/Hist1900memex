### Summary & Key Take Aways

A team of code-breakers where able to decypher over 50 letters written by Mary, Queen of Scots while in captivity in England. She used a complex form of letterlocking to ensure her messages weren't tampered with and used an entirely unique set of graphical symbols to encrypt her letters. With this new found information the code-breakers hope to team up with historians in order to better understand Mary and her life during captivity.

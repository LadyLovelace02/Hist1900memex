### Summary & Key Take Aways

An interview with Pam Hardt about her experiences with Project one and "community memory". An interesting pre-cursor to the internet designed by a commune without the burden of the government or universities dictating what is useful to impliment and not. It is a facinating interview to learn more about the attitudes of people towards computers and computer networks in the 70s with specific mention to computers relation to political events of the era like the war in Vietnam. Overall I found it focused too little on the computer component of the experience which is fine and I found it facinating but it does make it slightly more disjointed as far as this memex is concerned.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

This paper discusses discrimination in the early stages of the modern industry of computing and computer science. It discusses the post-war publication of the ENIAC project and the systematic discrediting and scilencing of womens efforts alongside their prompt removal from their jobs in the post-war economy. The paper also discusses how the roots of computer science are in women and where at the time gendered feminine and the modern conception of computer science as a "masculine" profession are deeply misunderstanding its roots.

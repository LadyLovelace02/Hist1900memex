### Summary & Key Take Aways

A paper summarizing and discussing the book How not to network a nation which discusses the history of the history of computers and computer networks in the USSR. It talks about how the conceptualization of the internet was formed by the communist system in the USSR and how they planned to create it in its vision and how they planned it to impact how the government was run and ultimitly the reasons it failed to come to fruition. It also discusses the differences in how the USSR and USA worked on their computer networks and ironically how the USA's model was originally created in a much more socialistic vision that that of the USSR internet. 

I think its especially facinating comparing how the two went about creating a computer network, how one was much more centralized and the other much less so and more done out of passion than out of utility.

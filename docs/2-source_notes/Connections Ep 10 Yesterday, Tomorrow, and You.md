### Summary & Key Take Aways

This final episode of season 1 of Connections discusses trends in the history of inventions, how they came to be, and what that process can tell us about the future and ourselves. Although flawed at points I think the analysis is generally accurate wherein history tends to be simplified into lines when in reality a lot of things came to be from lots of cross polination of ideas and seemingly random events and stimuli. He also talks about what to do next to counteract the comodification of knowledge and how capitalism is causing science to tend towards a knowledge monopoly which is bad for everyone. In the end the listener needs to decide which course of action is best, as there is no clear answer and James Burke leaves the answer open ended.

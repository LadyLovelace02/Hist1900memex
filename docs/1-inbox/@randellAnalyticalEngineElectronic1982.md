> - **Abstract:** This paper, based on an invited lecture given at MIT in March 1980, discusses the little-known work of Percy E. Ludgate (1883- 1922), Leonardo Torres y Quevedo (1852- 1936), and Vannevar Bush (1890- 1974). These three inventors, who apparently were unaware of one another's existence, were all directly influenced by know/edge of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, and each played a significant role in the history of the development of program-controlled computers.

> The machine that Ludgate describes in this paper was indeed a general-purpose program-controlled computer, mechanical in operation, although perhaps powered by an electric motor. It was to be capable of storing 192 numbers, each of 20 decimal digits, and would perform all the basic arithmetic operations. It was to work automatically under the control of a perforated tape, or could be controlled manually from a keyboard.

> In 1911 he made and successfully demonstrated (Scientific American Suppl. 1915) a chess-playing automaton for the end game of king and rook against king (Figure 10). This chess automaton, believed to have been the world’s first (the one earlier apparent chessautomaton, exhibited by von Kempelen, turned out to have small human operator hidden inside it; see Chapuis and Droz 1958), was fully automatic, with electrical sensing of the pieces on the board and what was in effect a mechanical arm to move its own pieces.

> The machine was to be completely automatic, able to read data on perforated paper tape, to store the data in internal registers, to perform any of the four basic arithmetic operations, and to print the results of its calculations. It was to be controlled by a program represented on perforated tape. Each row of holes would consist of several fields that together constituted one instruction. Each field could contain but a single punched hole, whose position indicated directly which operation was to be performed, say, or which storage reservoir was to provide the operand.

> The great principles on which the Analytical Engine rests have been examined, admitted, recorded and demonstrated. The mechanism itself has now been reduced to unexpected simplicity. Half a century may probably elapse before anyone without those aids which I leave behind me will attempt so unpromising a task. If, unwarned by my example, any man shall undertake and shall succeed in really constructing an engine embodying in itself the whole of the executive department of mathematical analysis upon different principles or by simpler means, I have no fear of leaving my reputation in his charge, for he alone will be fully able to appreciate the nature of my efforts and the value of my results.

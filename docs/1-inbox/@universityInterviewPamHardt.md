> we were able to organize so quickly, because of that mentality of putting the resources where they need to be.

>> This is a big benefit of the internet as we understand it, things that wouldn't have been possible now are because of the mass levels of communication that are possible now and the access to resources like she's talking about

> I think one of the things that's interesting is just, and I'm sure this is true now as it was then, but young people don't know their limits. You know, you just think you can do anything.

>> This is something i'm trying to develop and learn. The power of asking is truly very strong and saying yes to opportunities really can change your life!

> be like a switchboard or like a phone book, but be automatic so that people could go into someplace and say I need this service, or I need this doctor, or what do I do about this? And they could find the answer.

> so that's the next thing with Community Memory. It was after I left that they started using the computer to do a directory so that people could subscribe to the directory and then get a new directory—a printed directory of services, things that were going on in San Francisco or in the area. And then Lee Felsenstein took one of the terminals and set it up at one of the bookstores so then people would have access, kind of like you have with your phones now to do that.

>> That's so cool! seeing how all this technology works and gets created to eventually become the internet is crazy. I really like the non-capitalistic nature of this work, and others like it before the internet was invaded by capitalism

> When I was growing up, if you saw a marijuana cigarette, it would lead you to heroin. I mean, everybody was irrational and the people in Congress still are, but they’re a bunch of old guys. Young people know that that's not true.

> I guess one takeaway is that young people can do a lot if they want to. I guess that we can affect change. And I think learning about consensus, not letting the majority just bulldoze their way through is important for me.

>> this is very understated in life I've found. The power of trying things is very strong because few ever do. And that is something we need to be reminded of more often

> One of the women seemed to notice that sometimes women got talked over because we weren't loud enough. We would try to support each other by saying, What did you say, you know, Sally, which I'm sure exists today in groups.

>> This is an issue I have experienced in class and especially computer science, I wish support methods like this where more normalized

>> as the Chair of the Women in Computer Science club, I have a very similar lived experience, sometimes horrible treatment is just so tragically normalized

> Well, I think it was just getting timesharing started. We wanted to do all the things you can do right now, but we were getting started with this time-sharing that could, I think, support like nine different modems or ten—a small number, but I think it got people thinking of things that we could do.

>> This is so cool! And such a facinating pre-cursour to the internet. And its interesting how it does it in a non-capitalistic way

> - **Abstract:** The paper discusses the evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to the web-based catalogue. In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users.

> Further improvements in OPACs were regarded as third generation OPACs post 1996. OPACs of this generation were user-friendly, had improved search capabilities with free text search and enriched database. These OPACs were capable of providing links to external full-text indexes, databases, and e-journals on the internet17.

> One of IT’s greatest accomplishments is transformation of the card catalogue to the OPAC to facilitate libraries. An OPAC is a library catalogue accessed via a computer terminal for the benefit of library users. It is a computerised catalogue of documents and reading materials available in a library.

#### Agree

> OPAC offers a greater number of access points for a single record; • It provides access to a wide coverage of information quickly; • It provides information which may not be available in the printed form; • It connects to current information since online databases are updated speedily and more frequently; • It eliminates need for tedious clerical work of typing and arranging catalogue cards; • It offers faster search facilities and the capability of Boolean searching13.

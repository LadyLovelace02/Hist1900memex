> Until the 1950s, published copies of photographs that each woman scanned bore her name. Yet eventually the status of these women's work eroded. Later publications were subsumed under the name of the lab leader, inevitably a man, and publicity photographs rarely, showcased women's contributions.

>> It is important to talk about historical instances of this sort of erasure occurring because it shows how just introducing women into a field is not sufficient to create an equal field and that gender inequality isn't a case of lack of interest but concious or unconcious bias

> 5 The result is a distorted history of technological development that has rendered women's contributions invis ible and promoted a diminished view of women's capabilities in this field. These incomplete stories emphasize the notion that programming and coding are, and were, masculine activities. As computers saturate daily life, it becomes critical to write women back into the history they were always a part of, in action if not in memory.

> 3 In a number of laboratories, scientists described women not as individuals, but rather as a collective, defined by their lab leader ("Cecil's Beauty Chorus") or by their machines ("scanner girls"). Likewise in the ENIAC project, female operators are referred to as "[John] Holberton's group" or as "ENIAC girls."

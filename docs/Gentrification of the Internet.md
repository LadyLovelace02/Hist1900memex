- The internet in the era of "web 2.0" has become a spy and ad riddled mess
- when asked about it in calss Professor Shawn Graham responded the best way to react the this "enshitification" of the internet was the "burn it all to the ground"
	- this reminded me of the solutions posed to rapid technological advancement talked about in [[Connections Ep 10 Yesterday, Tomorrow, and You]] 
- buisiness model
	- get users invested in your system by making a good product
		- get the users stuck on your product by destroying competition
	- get businesses on board because you are where the users are
		- get buisinesses stuck in your product because of binding contracts and such
	- then make your product shitty by riddling it with spyware and ads
		- but no one can leave and your product is an instramental part of daily life now
			- profit

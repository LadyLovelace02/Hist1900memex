-   Many people throughout the history of the internet (and history in general) had various bigoted beliefs that get ignored as "a product of their time"
	- However viewing it as such in my opinion deminishes the harm done 
		- appealing to anticuity seems to allow people to "get away" with their "old fashioned" beliefs which tends to ignore the harm they caused
		- For example Dewey's Racism and Sexism is often ignored as being "of his time" but this stops us from discussing the impact that has had and from changing his system which is still often in place today and still causes harm to certain groups
	- and doesn't give historical people enough credit
		- Often times because of hindsight people tend to have the belief (concious or not) that people historically weren't as inteligent as we are today (often because we have modern technology. However of course this is not the case and it doesn't take the mass of modern information to understand that women are people, people of colour are people and both groups deserve more respect and credit
		- Slavery is often a victim of this where people think for some reason that the concept of slavery being immoral some how escaped people. They simply didn't care, which is the harder truth to take.

-   A cryptographic method created by the British during world war 2 
	- was based on the [[Enigma]] cypher but removed the flaw that allowed the british to crack it (a letter encyrpting to itself)
	- This proved to be a more secure cypher with the Nazi's during world war 2 determining the british cypher to be better than [[Enigma]] and they gave up trying to decrypt it
		- At least that is what is publically known on the topic, lots of cryptographic history is still top seceret information

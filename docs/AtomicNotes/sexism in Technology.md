- a lot of work in computing was done by women who classically recieved little to no credit
- "I would like to say right here... what our experience has been with young ladies' help; the service is very much superior to that of boys and men. They are steadier, do not drink beer and are always on hand". - [[Alexander Graham Bell]] 
- [[lack of Ada Lovelace]]
- women programmed the [[Mauchly & ENIAC]] and weren't credited it for it
	- this reflects how [[Ada Lovelace]] did the theoretical work of figuring out how to use an [[Analytical Engine]] if it where ever built while as [[Charles Babbage]] worked on the physical side of creating the device itself
- [[Grace Hopper]] was also largely uncredited for her work
- [[Women created modern programming]]
- women also helped with
	- the business end of advertising computers
	- the IT side of it
	- and more
- the management roles where coded male and there was a social pressure to remove the female workers as they held power in the form of knowledge
	- the women trained their male replacements
		- this was a direct instruction from the higher ups
	- Women where socially pushed out of the field in order to make way for "upper clas white men"

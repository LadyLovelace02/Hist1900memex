-   was closer to specialized computers like those used by [[Vannevar Bush]] 
- Bombe was designed specifically to do logical deduction in order to decrypt the enigma cyper
	- worked through process of elimination
	- given an encrypted message and the expected output ie "Heil Hitler" at the end of transmissions 
		- the fact a letter would never encrypt to itself could be used to partially tell what the message was
		- then Bombe worked by assuming a connection on the plug board ie T-A and follow that logic, making more assumptions until a contradiction was hit
			- The key was once a contradition was hit you knew that all previous assumptions made MUST be incorrect and if all combinations are eliminated then the rotar position must be wrong so iterate that and restart
	- Bombe was able to do this process way faster than humans and enabled the code to be cracked in approximately 20 minutes
	- information from [[158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (Enigma Machine) & Flaw in the Enigma Code]]

##### Description

The Dewey-Decimal system was a method of organizing libraries based on the continuous property of the real numbers, called the Dewey-Decimal system. The decimal system allowed new classifications to be inserted between others without having to rename the old ones.

##### Connections

-   Dewey used this [organizational system](https://camiregu.github.io/camila-memex/website/3_atomic_notes/organizing-information.html#)

    to implement and spread his organizational system, which then affected the power of other groups being sorted in that system. For example, numbers 200-290 are dedicated to Christianity, while only 291-300 are used for all the other religions in the world.
-   This is also a great showcase of how [mediums can impact messages](https://camiregu.github.io/camila-memex/website/3_atomic_notes/impact-of-mediums-on-messages.html#)

    ! Under Dewey, all books from black authors were placed under the 'Slavery' section and queer topics under 'Mental Illness'. This certainly affects how a reader will receive the information in the book.
-   Dewey was a well-known racist and anti-semite even for his time, and faced several accusations of sexual harassment. This was reflected in how he used his power, as discussed above. However, [there were no mentions of this history in class](https://camiregu.github.io/camila-memex/website/4-idea_notes/why-is-north-america's-history-of-fascism-so-often-erased-in-historical-education.html#)

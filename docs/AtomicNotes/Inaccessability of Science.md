- Because of the accessability of communication with others in a field specialized language was made to be able to talk about nuanced topics
	- this happened first with the [[printing press]] which began making science inaccessable to the layperson
		- before the [[printing press]] [[water power]] was the norm, which was simple for anyone to understand
		- however after that more advanced technologies where invented like the [[steam engine]] which are harder to comprehend and its only gotten more complex to the degree of [[nuclear energy]] today
	- [[Connections Ep 10 Yesterday, Tomorrow, and You]] goes on to speculate about how we are about to (as of 1970) go through a "communiction revolution" which correctly predicted the internet
		- it discusses how this would even further seperate the average person from science and invention
	- that prediction was absolutely true and the internet has drastically changed science as an industry and made it more innaccessable in many ways

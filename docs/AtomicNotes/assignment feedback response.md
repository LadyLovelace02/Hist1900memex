# Assignment 1
```
**Things to work on next**: 
Including your annotations is recommended. 
Key Take Aways could be expanded;
source notes are perhaps too-short summaries. 
Take a look at the guidance on a writing a precis/source note; 
in a way, they are like your response to the author in a dialogue. 
Map of Content note could be expanded from headings to explain to the reader what they can expect in your memex, overarching themes and ideas. Idea/atomic notes need to be fleshed out more and show that you have _worked through_ some of the themes/topics/people discussed in class. It’s ok to include your class notes as notes, but you want to use those as starting points to then build off of. More interlinkages between notes are recommended; let your ideas talk to each other. Linking out to external sources is also recommended.
```
## Annotations
- I included all anotations I made, the first few readings I did didn't contain annotations because I was still learning zotero and don't find annotations intuative
	- I will try to annotate more often
- I have tried to expand my summaries
	- I was trying to have my source notes be a more unbiased description of the content
		- I will try to make them more opinionated
- I will try to flesh out my atomic notes further
	- However I find having many very concise atomic notes more helpful than writting a lot on few notes
	- this may just be a difference in how we take notes
		- but I will try
- I will try to explain my topics in the [[index]] page
- I have allocated more time working on the assignment to "gardening" my memex to try and make better atomic nots facilitate more connections between notes

# Assignment 2 
## feedback
-  make own templates that are more useful for me
- make more linkages to other memex's
- write what is unique to what needs to be said in relation to the course and not just basic information

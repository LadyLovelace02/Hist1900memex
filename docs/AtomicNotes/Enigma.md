-   A complex encryption tool used to impliment a subsitition cyper
- posed a large threat the the Allies who worked hard to decrypt it
- the key to decryption ended up being that a letter would never be encrypted as itself
- worked by setting a combination of 10 pairs of letters to each other and selecting 3 of 5 possible rotors and a unique starting position on each rotar in order to encrypt messages in such a way that your unique encryption method is one of approximately 150 trillion (see [[158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (Enigma Machine) & Flaw in the Enigma Code]])
	- the Bombe ([[Bombe to Colossus]]) was created by [[Alan Turing]] and [[Hut 8 & Bletchly Park]] in order to decrypt these messages, because the algorithm was too complex to crack in a timely manner (given the codes are changed every 24 hours) using human computers

-   used [[boolean logic]] to compute all that is computable as proven by [[Alan Turing]]
- the turing machine is still theoretical at the moment
	- this plus [[Claud Shanon]]'s work on [[information theory]] and [[circuits]] could be used to create a basic digital computer
- [[Charles Babbage]]'s differential engine had no social pressure to be made so it was neat but not needed
	- while as [[Alan Turing]]'s work had a social nessesity that made it catch popularity

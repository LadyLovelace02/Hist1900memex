[[telegraph]] [[The Space Economy]] [[History of Electricity]]

- the optical telegraph was invented to fight the [[french revolution]]
	- soon after other nations also developed the optical telegraph
- Ralph Wedgewood made an electrical telegraph
	- but the british admiralty says no and never used it
- Francis Ronald came up with it again 2 years later the admiralty refused it again
	- the admiralty decided "telegraphs where wholly unessisary due to the existance of semophores and flag waving"
- the telegraph owes its existance to the Galvanometer which was created during experiments [[testing galvanism]]
- due to the [[steam engine]] trains have sprung up and need to not crash into eachother
	- so the telegraph was needed for instant communication
	- several people around the same time approach the railroads and get pattants to create telegraphs
- finally Morse made his own [[telegraph]]
	- was powered by clockwork like the [[verge and foliate clock]] 
	- finally [[morse code]] was created
- progression mirrors that of the modern internet

[[Connections Faith in Numbers episode 4]] was worked on in collaberation with:
Mace, Camilla, and Erin

[[Connections Wheel of Fortune Episode 5]] was worked on in collaberation with: Erin

[[Connections Ep 10 Yesterday, Tomorrow, and You]] was worked on in collaberation with: Erin, Mace, Camilla

[[158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (Enigma Machine) & Flaw in the Enigma Code]] was watched alongside Mace, and Camilla and we discussed the topics within it so our ideas may be similar. Erin was also shared the content and recommended it by us

### Noteworthy
- [[Theory is cool because if I don't write this down Dr Graham will get mad]]

### Computers
Computers are the backbone of the internet, without which none of it would have been possible in the form it exists in today. They have undeniably changed how most everyone lives their daily lives.

### Women's role in early Computing
Sexism pushed women out of many working roles and where largely uncredited in the scientific field even when their help was instremental to a given project. This fact is very true with the field of computing wherein as discussed women created the first programming languages and concepts to the extent where Grace Hopper invented the first compiler without which programming would be an even more impossable task than it can be proceieved as today. Their work was largely uncredited at the time, we can only hope to rectify that now by discussing their massive contributions to this field!

### electricity
Electricity is a fundamental discovery to all the networks discussed in class (bar perhaps Semaphores) and because of this need to be discussed in order to understand the history of computers, networks, and the internet.

### information transfer
One of the main things the internet changed about modern life, is the speed of communication. The history of which is pivital to that of the internet. First it was revolutionized by the printing press, then later the electronic telegraph, then again by the telephone, and eventially by the internet.

### information storage
Originally the internet was just a series of connections between computers containing scientific information. The internet was originally about sharing and storing information effectively. Because of this the history of the internet intersects with how data has been stored historically including the dewey decimal system and more.

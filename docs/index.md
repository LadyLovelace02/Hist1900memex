## Feedback and Response
[[assignment feedback response]] 
- Thoughts about memex 2 work
	- I am happy with the sources I added to my memex for this assignment I think they are very interesting and I like how they play on their own parts of the history of the internet and yet can be connected
	- Additionally I only have one external reference at the moment, for the next assignment I hope to add more its just they weren't my focus for this memex
	- I have tried to iterate my work off of your feedback, see note above
## Thoughts on my submission for Memex 3
- I have finished my 3rd memex submission and am happy with the sources I have added!
	- However I've found that throughout the course my note taking methods have changed
	- for this memex I've put extra effort into the summaries of my sources and consiquently made less atomic notes about them
		- I hope my summaries and thoughts are sufficiently nuanced.

[[Connections Faith in Numbers episode 4]] was worked on in collaberation with:
Mace, Camilla, and Erin

[[Connections Wheel of Fortune Episode 5]] was worked on in collaberation with: Erin

[[Connections Ep 10 Yesterday, Tomorrow, and You]] was worked on in collaberation with: Erin, Mace, Camilla

[[158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (Enigma Machine) & Flaw in the Enigma Code]] was watched alongside Mace, and Camilla and we discussed the topics within it so our ideas may be similar. Erin was also shared the content and recommended it by us

### Internet
The internet is the overarching theme of the course, its been a long time coming to get here but we finally are and its a weave of technologies we've discussed in class. The computer is used to connect together the internet, phones are used as modems and their pre-existing infrastructure is used to link computers together. BBS systems are used to allow people to communicate and find things. People are creating their own forms of internets in their local area's. However over time companies manage to ruin a good thing.

Computers are the backbone of the internet, without which none of it would have been possible in the form it exists in today. They have undeniably changed how most everyone lives their daily lives.

### Women's role in early Computing
Sexism pushed women out of many working roles and where largely uncredited in the scientific field even when their help was instremental to a given project. This fact is very true with the field of computing wherein as discussed women created the first programming languages and concepts to the extent where Grace Hopper invented the first compiler without which programming would be an even more impossable task than it can be proceieved as today. Their work was largely uncredited at the time, we can only hope to rectify that now by discussing their massive contributions to this field!

### electricity
Electricity is a fundamental discovery to all the networks discussed in class (bar perhaps Semaphores) and because of this need to be discussed in order to understand the history of computers, networks, and the internet.

### information transfer
One of the main things the internet changed about modern life, is the speed of communication. The history of which is pivital to that of the internet. First it was revolutionized by the printing press, then later the electronic telegraph, then again by the telephone, and eventially by the internet.

### information storage
Originally the internet was just a series of connections between computers containing scientific information. The internet was originally about sharing and storing information effectively. Because of this the history of the internet intersects with how data has been stored historically including the dewey decimal system and more.
